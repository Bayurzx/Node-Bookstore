## *This code was designed for a store that can be easily updated through the manage section and displayed at the frontend check out is done through paypal*

#**Take note!!!**

- This is a project improved from an online tutorial/project
- Some dependencies in use are deprecated such as requestjs
- Some of the images used are from pinterest (Use at your own risk)
- This project makes use of express, kraken (yo kraken) I am really looking for an alternative as many of the chosen packages where deprecated
- I plan on separating the manage and frontend using a login system

> Enjoy messing around with the repo
